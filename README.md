## Wine Ratings - Which Wine is the Best?
For this project I would like to find which wine really is the best by using four different datasets that cover red, rose, white, and sparkling wines.

### Description
I have never been a big wine drinking person, although everyone else around me loves it. I also know next to zero on the subject, so I decided for this project to find the best wine by rating, but also find which wine is best for me. I know I prefer sweeter wines, but I'm curious to see what type of wine is the most popular? Where is the best region to get the best wine? Is there a reason that region is the best? Does the year really matter when it comes to taste? I plan to look into these questions and more while digging into the four datasets that I will combine into one.
